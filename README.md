# RGB-based-Andorid-Malware-detection
 please follow the instructions to install and run the code. 
 
 System Requirement and Installation: 

●	Install Ubuntu
●	Install Anaconda, for  python


Download Dataset, Pre processing and Training a Malware Detector
●	Download the AndroZoo dataset, containing benign and malware APKs.
○	APKs can be downloaded from an API by providing an APK SHA256 hash by using the following script.(Downloading_APKs.ipynb) Both API and APK’s SHA256 are given by AndroZoo. 
●	Extracting androidmanfestfiles.xml and classes.dex file from an APK by using Androguard
●	Converting an APK to an image (fileName:APK_to_images(Androguard_and_preDefined_Values)_Version_2.ipynb).
○	Extract different properties from all these extracted files.
○	Converting those properties to an integer values (predefined + calculation)
○	Can select custom APKs based on publishing date, number of vt_detection (detected by # of softwares in VirusTotal) etc.
○	Place different properties on different channels.
○	Interpolate all channels to a fixed size.
○	Merge all channels to make an image.
●	Training a Deep Learning Model
○	Converting APKs images to .npy file for training a model.
○	Load .npy file to train model
○	Make labels, ‘0’ for benign and ‘1’ for malware.

Implementing DroidDetector (P1)
●	DroidDetector based on binary vectors
○	First extract different  properties from an APK to file using script
○	Convert those properties to a binary vector (Preprocessing for DroidDetector). (APK2Vector)
○	Train DNN model on binary vector using following script

Implementing Malware Detection Based on CNN (P9)
●	Malware Detection Based on CNN
○	First extract different  properties from an APK to file using script
○	Pre processing 
○	Train a CNN model

Generating Adversarial Examples
●	Generating Adversarial Examples with Pre defined benign properties (Attack1:-FileName: Generating_Random_benign)
○	Convert an APK to image.
○	Append benign properties.
●	Generating bening APKs using GANs (Attack2)
○	Generating benign APKs using DCGAN
○	Generating benign APKs using WGAN
○	Generating benign APKs using LSGAN

Attacks on Models
●	Attacks on own model, P1 and P9 Detectors
○	Attack via Attack1
■	Own Detector
■	P1
■	P9
○	Attack via Attack2
■	Own Detector
■	P1
■	P9
